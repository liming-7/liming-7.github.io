I am Ming Li (李明), now a Postdoc Researcher at University of Amsterdam (UvA). I got my Ph.D. at [IRLab](https://irlab.science.uva.nl/), University of Amsterdam (UvA), supervised by [Prof. Dr. Maarten de Rijke](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/) and [Dr. Andrew Yates](https://andrewyates.net/). I was a member in AIRLab in collaboration with [Ahold Delhaize](https://www.aholddelhaize.com/about/research-development/). I received my bachelor and master degree in Computer Science from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, [UESTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Electronic_Science_and_Technology_of_China) in 2016 and 2019, respectively.

**Research Interest:** Recommender Systems, Information Retrieval, Retrieval augmented machine learning, LLM.

**Ph.D. Research Summary:** Collaborated with Europe's largest retail company (Ahold Delhaize) on recommendation research within the smart retail scenario, resulting in several publications in top-tier conferences/journals (RecSys, SIGIR, TOIS, TORS, etc); some related research findings have been applied to real-world applications.

**Current Project:** Now, I am currently working on building up the using\&fine-tuning LLM pipeline for Information Retrieval research.
